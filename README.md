# ALGO TRADING STRATEGY USING EMA CROSSOVER
An "Algo Trading strategy using EMA crossover" is a quantitative trading strategy that generates buy and sell signals based on the intersection points of two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with different timeframes, where a crossover between the shorter-term EMA crossing above the longer-term EMA indicates a potential buy signal, and vice versa for a sell signal; essentially using the shift in momentum suggested by the crossover to identify potential trend changes in the market.
